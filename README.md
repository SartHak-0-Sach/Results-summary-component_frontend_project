## Overview

### The Challenge

Present your data in an organized and visually appealing way with the Results Summary Component. Perfect for displaying analytics and insights for your audience.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Designing and implementing a structured layout for displaying data and analytics
- Styling and customizing components for improved visual appeal and user engagement
- Enhancing accessibility and usability with intuitive navigation and interactive elements

Also through this project I got to know about negation pseudo-class and how to use direct children node selector in a complex HTML document as shown in CSS code snippet below-

```css
.summary-list-item>span:not(.item-score) {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
